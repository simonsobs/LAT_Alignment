64 point sparse polyline surface measurement taken by Anna and Michele on the real mirror panel at Vertex.
SMR was handled by Michele and computer by Anna.
Coordinate system was the global coordinate system provided by the vertex solid works model for the mirror. A 200 cm offset is still seen in the x-axis positions of the adjusters.
