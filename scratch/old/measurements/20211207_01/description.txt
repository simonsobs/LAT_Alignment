Measurement taken of reject panel during FARO training.
Panel was mounted on table with holes drilled in it.
SMR was handled by Michele and computer by Anna.
Coordinate system was the cad coordinate system but was aligned by the panel corners which is not ideal.
Some concerns about how things are compensated. Unclear how the polyline compensation works, also the corner points were uncompensated by an inch.
